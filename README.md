# ⚡️Harry Potter⚡️

This project was built using React. The goal was to create a Harry Potter character finder through an API.

You can also click on any given character card to find more info about it.

## What does the web do?

⚡️The app must fetch from an API.
⚡️Render the characters information on the home page. Required information is: Picture, name and specie.
⚡️Add a filter that allows the user to search by name any character.
⚡️There are four mandatory components: Filters, CharacterList, CharacterCard and Character.
⚡️If the user search an unexistant character we must give a feedback.
⚡️The filter must work either if the user writes with caps on or not.
⚡️When in the character detail if the user wants to go back to the home page the search input value must remain.
⚡️I add some styles (don't blame me, I'm not a designer)
⚡️Use grid for the character list.
⚡️Make it responsive.
⚡️Show icons for house and ancestry. Yep, I also thake some fan literature freedom...
⚡️The character URL must be shareable.
⚡️If we refresh the browser, character information must be kept.
⚡️If the user goes to unexistant pages we must give a proper feedback.
⚡️Add an extra filter to search by specie.

## Can you help me to improve?

I am a lawyer turned front-end developer so I still have a lot to learn. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome.
